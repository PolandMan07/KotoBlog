        <h2><em><u>About me</u></em></h2>
        I'm a normal 13-year old. I like some kinds of technology, mostly if it has a screen (phones, computers, tablets, etc)
        I've got more than 70 mobile phones in my collection, and I also really like cats.
        I've liked them for as long as I can remember, but it was during our 2019 vacation that I really started to love cats. Me and my parents were at a hotel
        in Greece, and lots of cats were there.
        I could stroke them. Over a year ago, I read about how someone got a puppy for Christmas,then I really 
        wanted a cat for my birthday. We reserved cats twice, but 
        the sellers in both cases cancelled me getting the cat, instead getting a refund, right before we were supposed to collect them. Once it was cancelled "because the kids loved it"
        and then it was put up for sale at a bigger price. And then we came across 
        my cats, because we didn't want a reservation. There were two (nice surprise) because every cat book says that having two cats is better than one. 
        This is true. We took my cute little kittens home.
        <h2><em><u>About my cats</u></em></h2>
        I have two cats The bigger, older, orange tabby cat is Felix. And the smaller, younger, mostly white cat is Luna. When they were tiny, 
        then Luna was almost always on someone's lap, and Felix walked around the living room, curious about where everything is.
        They are on one of the cat photos. Now they like to go on tables.
        Felix loves to purr, and Luna purrs only when someone's in the bathroom. Then she tries to squeeze into the bathroom if the door isn't open. I 
        <em>really</em>
        love my cats. :-)
        <h2><em><u>About KotoBlog</u></em></h2>
        I made KotoBlog using an online course from Wow School, the internet and Visual Studio Code, which mahes writing code / programming much easier.
        This means that I wrote all of the code by myself, without using website makers like Wix or Wordpress, but in HTML, CSS and
        Javascript.
